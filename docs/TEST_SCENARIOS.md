Below are five sample test cases for each major module in the Ashtabula system. These tests can be extended or adapted as needed, but they provide a concrete starting point to ensure coverage of typical and edge scenarios.

⸻

1. WebSocket Server (ashtabula/websocket.py)
	1.	Basic Connection & Chunking
	•	Scenario: A client establishes a WebSocket connection and streams 2 seconds of WAV audio at a chunk size of 1 second.
	•	Input: WAV audio data sent in 100ms increments.
	•	Expected Result: The server buffers data, emits exactly two chunks (1 second each) to the STT module, and closes the connection cleanly.
	•	Pass Criteria: The STT module receives each chunk with correct byte size, and no errors are logged.
	2.	Unsupported Format Handling
	•	Scenario: A client sends audio data in an unsupported format (e.g., MP3 if not implemented).
	•	Input: MP3-encoded data sent over the WebSocket.
	•	Expected Result: The server logs an error or returns a specific error message to the client indicating unsupported format.
	•	Pass Criteria: No crash; a graceful error or closure is triggered.
	3.	High Concurrency
	•	Scenario: Ten clients connect concurrently, each streaming short audio clips.
	•	Input: Each client sends 1-second audio in various formats (Opus, FLAC, WAV).
	•	Expected Result: The server processes all streams without degradation or data mix-ups.
	•	Pass Criteria: All 10 connections remain open, each chunk is properly routed to the correct session.
	4.	Corrupted Chunk Recovery
	•	Scenario: A client sends partially corrupted data in the middle of the stream.
	•	Input: The first chunk is valid, the second is corrupted, the third is valid.
	•	Expected Result: The server detects corruption, logs an error, but continues processing subsequent valid chunks.
	•	Pass Criteria: The server doesn’t crash; only the corrupted chunk is discarded.
	5.	Chunk Size Variations
	•	Scenario: The server is configured for a range of chunk durations (0.5s, 1s, 2s).
	•	Input: Simulated audio data for each configuration.
	•	Expected Result: The server correctly chunks data according to the chosen configuration, each chunk is passed to STT on time.
	•	Pass Criteria: No overlap or missed data when switching chunk configurations.

2. Session State Management (ashtabula/buffer.py, ashtabula/conversation.py)
	1.	Partial Transcription Accumulation
	•	Scenario: The STT module provides incremental transcription: “Hell,” “Hello w,” “Hello world.”
	•	Input: Three partial text updates for the same utterance.
	•	Expected Result: The buffer updates each time, eventually storing “Hello world” as the final partial transcription.
	•	Pass Criteria: The final buffer state accurately reflects “Hello world” with timestamps.
	2.	Session Reset on Finalization
	•	Scenario: A user speaks a single utterance, the VAD signals end of speech, and the conversation manager finalizes. Another utterance starts.
	•	Input: Two consecutive utterances separated by silence.
	•	Expected Result: The session state for the first utterance is cleared before tracking the second utterance.
	•	Pass Criteria: Data from the first utterance does not leak into the second session buffer.
	3.	Predicted Sentence Storage
	•	Scenario: The system stores multiple predicted sentences for partial utterances: “Hello,” “Hello world,” “Hello world is big.”
	•	Input: The conversation manager logs these predictions before finalizing.
	•	Expected Result: The buffer or conversation context maintains a list of predictions along with timestamps for each update.
	•	Pass Criteria: The stored predictions can be retrieved and matched with actual final utterance for comparison.
	4.	Embedding Storage & Retrieval
	•	Scenario: When the final utterance is detected, an embedding is computed and stored.
	•	Input: “Hello world” text triggers an embedding pass.
	•	Expected Result: The conversation context holds an embedding vector for “Hello world.”
	•	Pass Criteria: The retrieved embedding matches the vector from the embedding model (within a floating-point tolerance).
	5.	Long Silence Handling
	•	Scenario: No speech is detected for 30 seconds after partial transcription.
	•	Input: A single partial transcription “Hello” is never finalized, then the system times out.
	•	Expected Result: The session should be reset after the configured timeout or upon a forced “reset” command.
	•	Pass Criteria: The buffer is cleared, and no session data remains.

3. Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
	1.	Simple Speech/No-Speech Detection
	•	Scenario: A 5-second WAV file with 2 seconds of speech in the middle and 1.5 seconds silence before/after.
	•	Input: Audio chunked at 0.5s intervals.
	•	Expected Result: VAD detects a single speech segment in the middle.
	•	Pass Criteria: Start-of-speech and end-of-speech timestamps are accurate within ±200ms.
	2.	Continuous Speech with Minimal Pauses
	•	Scenario: A speaker talks almost continuously for 10 seconds with just brief 100ms pauses.
	•	Input: 10-second audio data with short natural gaps.
	•	Expected Result: VAD should consider it as a single utterance if the silence threshold is >100ms.
	•	Pass Criteria: The system finalizes only once at the end.
	3.	Noisy Background
	•	Scenario: 5 seconds of speech with significant ambient noise.
	•	Input: Audio chunk with 2 seconds of speech and 3 seconds of background noise.
	•	Expected Result: VAD must still identify the speech portion without false positives for noise.
	•	Pass Criteria: The recognized speech segment aligns with the ground truth speech interval.
	4.	Overlapping Speakers
	•	Scenario: Two voices overlap for part of the recording.
	•	Input: A single channel audio that has overlapping segments.
	•	Expected Result: VAD identifies continuous speech, but it might not separate speakers (if the model isn’t designed for diarization).
	•	Pass Criteria: No unreasonably long silence detections; the overlap is recognized as speech.
	5.	Aggressiveness Configuration
	•	Scenario: Test multiple aggressiveness levels (e.g., for webrtcvad: 0,1,2,3).
	•	Input: The same audio sample with minor noise.
	•	Expected Result: Each aggressiveness setting yields different sensitivity to short silences.
	•	Pass Criteria: Document which segments are detected as speech for each aggressiveness level, matching the expectations.

4. Whisper STT (ashtabula/stt.py)
	1.	Basic Transcription Accuracy
	•	Scenario: A clean WAV file with the phrase “This is a test.”
	•	Input: “This is a test” audio.
	•	Expected Result: Output text with minimal error, e.g. exact match or near match for short phrases.
	•	Pass Criteria: The transcription is “This is a test” or close enough for acceptable WER.
	2.	Streaming Partial Transcriptions
	•	Scenario: Send live audio in 0.5-second increments.
	•	Input: 2 seconds of audio (“Hello World”) in four separate chunks.
	•	Expected Result: STT produces partial strings that update: “He,” “Hell,” “Hello,” “Hello World.”
	•	Pass Criteria: The final partial matches “Hello World.”
	3.	Language Support Check (if configured)
	•	Scenario: The user speaks in another language (Spanish or French) if the model supports it.
	•	Input: “Hola mundo” in Spanish.
	•	Expected Result: Whisper STT detects and transcribes in Spanish accurately, if the language model is multi-lingual.
	•	Pass Criteria: The final transcription is “Hola mundo” or close enough to be recognized.
	4.	No Speech / Silence
	•	Scenario: The input audio has no voice, just silence for 5 seconds.
	•	Input: 5-second silent WAV file.
	•	Expected Result: The transcription is empty or states “[silence]” (depending on the model’s behavior).
	•	Pass Criteria: No erroneous words are recognized.
	5.	Fast Speech
	•	Scenario: A user talking rapidly for 3 seconds.
	•	Input: 3-second WAV with ~10 words spoken quickly.
	•	Expected Result: Transcription recognizes the majority of the words, though some errors might occur due to speed.
	•	Pass Criteria: The system should not crash or skip large portions of speech.

5. Conversation Manager (ashtabula/conversation.py)
	1.	Embedding Comparison with Stored Predictions
	•	Scenario: The manager has stored partial predictions “Hello,” “Hello world,” “Hi everyone.” The final utterance is “Hello world.”
	•	Input: A final recognized text “Hello world.”
	•	Expected Result: The manager calculates an embedding, compares, and sees a close match with the partial “Hello world.”
	•	Pass Criteria: The manager reuses the partial prediction’s response instead of generating a new one.
	2.	No Matching Prediction
	•	Scenario: The partial predictions deviate significantly from the final utterance.
	•	Input: Stored predictions are about greetings, but the final utterance is “Tell me a joke about pandas.”
	•	Expected Result: Cosine similarity threshold is not met; the manager requests a fresh response from the LLM.
	•	Pass Criteria: The fallback path to generate a new response is triggered.
	3.	Multiple Utterances in a Session
	•	Scenario: The user says two sentences in quick succession.
	•	Input: “Hello world,” short pause, “How are you?”
	•	Expected Result: The manager handles them as two separate utterances. Each is processed fully, responded to, then cleared.
	•	Pass Criteria: The conversation flow updates after each final response with no leftover data.
	4.	Timeout or Force Reset
	•	Scenario: The user remains silent after partial utterances for an extended period, or an admin command triggers a reset.
	•	Input: A partial utterance is never finalized, then a reset event happens.
	•	Expected Result: The conversation manager discards partial data and resets.
	•	Pass Criteria: The next utterance starts fresh with no old partial data.
	5.	Parallel Generation & Evaluation
	•	Scenario: While waiting for a final utterance, partial text is used to generate a potential response. Then the final utterance arrives quickly.
	•	Input: The conversation manager is configured to do early generation for partial text.
	•	Expected Result: The final text might be different enough to require a new response, or the partial is close enough to reuse.
	•	Pass Criteria: Proper concurrency handling ensures no race conditions. The final chosen path is correct for the final text.

6. LLM Response Generation (ashtabula/llm.py)
	1.	Basic Prompt & Response
	•	Scenario: The user says “Hello, can you introduce yourself?”
	•	Input: A simple system prompt + user prompt to the LLM.
	•	Expected Result: The model returns a short introduction in a single turn.
	•	Pass Criteria: The response is well-formed text that matches the LLM’s capabilities.
	2.	Token Limit Boundary
	•	Scenario: The user inputs a long paragraph near the model’s maximum token limit.
	•	Input: ~4,000 tokens (depending on model capacity).
	•	Expected Result: The LLM handles the prompt up to its limit or gracefully truncates.
	•	Pass Criteria: No crash or incomplete error; the system handles large input gracefully.
	3.	Temperature Variation
	•	Scenario: The conversation manager sets different temperature values for the LLM to control creativity.
	•	Input: “Write a short poem about AI” with temperature = 0.7 vs. 0.1.
	•	Expected Result: High temperature yields more creative, varied output; low temperature yields more deterministic text.
	•	Pass Criteria: The differences in style confirm that temperature is being applied correctly.
	4.	Multi-turn Context
	•	Scenario: The conversation manager passes multiple past user turns to the LLM for context.
	•	Input: “What is your name?” then “Where do you live?” with context included.
	•	Expected Result: The LLM references its own name from the first turn when answering the second.
	•	Pass Criteria: The response demonstrates continuity across turns.
	5.	Error Handling / Timeout
	•	Scenario: The LLM request times out or the external service is unavailable.
	•	Input: The conversation manager attempts a generation call with a short timeout.
	•	Expected Result: A fallback error or partial response is handled gracefully.
	•	Pass Criteria: The system logs an error, notifies the user, and does not crash.

7. Text-to-Speech (TTS) (ashtabula/tts.py)
	1.	Basic TTS Output
	•	Scenario: A short sentence “Hello world” is passed to TTS.
	•	Input: “Hello world”
	•	Expected Result: An audio buffer is returned, playable at a standard sample rate (e.g., 16kHz or 22kHz).
	•	Pass Criteria: The output is intelligible speech matching the text.
	2.	Streaming Partial TTS (If Supported)
	•	Scenario: The LLM returns a partial text early, and TTS streams partial audio to the user.
	•	Input: “Once upon a time…” in chunks.
	•	Expected Result: The user hears the partial TTS segments.
	•	Pass Criteria: The partial audio segments can be appended seamlessly, with minimal buffering artifacts.
	3.	Unsupported Characters / Symbols
	•	Scenario: Input text contains special characters or emojis (e.g., “Hello world! 🚀”).
	•	Input: “Hello world! 🚀”
	•	Expected Result: The TTS either skips or phonetically spells out the unsupported symbol.
	•	Pass Criteria: No crash or unexpected exception occurs; TTS handles or ignores special symbols gracefully.
	4.	Long Form TTS
	•	Scenario: A paragraph of 200+ words is passed to TTS to test performance and memory handling.
	•	Input: A multi-sentence text passage.
	•	Expected Result: The module produces an audio buffer without truncation.
	•	Pass Criteria: No crash or partial output for large text.
	5.	Audio Format Variation
	•	Scenario: The TTS output sample rate is configurable (16kHz vs. 24kHz).
	•	Input: The same text, but system config is set to different output sample rates.
	•	Expected Result: The system generates playable audio at the specified rates.
	•	Pass Criteria: The saved or streamed audio’s metadata aligns with the chosen sample rate.
