# Generation Log for Ashtabula

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by the **Hugging Face** sticker found at a co-working space, reinforcing alignment with open-source AI.

## Original References & Prompts Used
1. **Project structure inspired by AI-Convo.**
2. **STT/LLM/TTS design built for real-time AI conversation systems.**
3. **Naming and branding influenced by historical mission-style architecture.**
4. **Technical design follows event-driven WebSocket AI streaming.**
5. **Inspired by Kwaai and SCaLE22x AI initiatives in Pasadena.**

## Generation Notes
- Project structure mirrors best practices for open-source AI frameworks.
- Ensured modularity to support future AI model integrations.
- WebSocket and buffer logic designed for low-latency response handling.
- Test cases cover core AI interaction scenarios.
- Included basic implementations while allowing extensibility.

## Next Steps
1. Develop a real-time demo for Ashtabula.
2. Integrate additional AI providers (Claude, self-hosted models).
3. Expand documentation with usage examples.
