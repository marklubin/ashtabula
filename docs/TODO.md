# Ashtabula Project - Implementation Progress & TODOs

## Work Completed

### Core Framework
- Created WebSocket server test suite with black-box testing methodology
- Implemented comprehensive STT validation framework for audio processing
- Designed STT provider interface with async streaming capabilities
- Added FastWhisper STT provider implementation with configurable parameters

### Test Infrastructure
- Built test runner for the FastWhisper provider
- Created m4a to wav conversion pipeline for test audio
- Established test fixtures for STT validation
- Implemented word error rate evaluation for transcription accuracy

### Strategic Positioning
- Identified alignment with Kwaai's pAI-OS platform
- Recognized opportunity at SCaLE22x Personal AI Summit
- Formulated objectives for potential collaborations

## TODOs

### Immediate Technical Tasks
- [ ] Install required Python dependencies (faster-whisper, pytest, pytest-asyncio)
- [ ] Run test suite against FastWhisper implementation
- [ ] Fix any failing tests and optimize performance
- [ ] Document test results and performance metrics

### WebSocket Server Implementation
- [ ] Implement the WebSocket server using the test-driven approach
- [ ] Add stream handling for real-time audio processing
- [ ] Implement client session management
- [ ] Add error handling and recovery mechanisms

### LLM Integration
- [ ] Design LLM provider interface similar to STT provider
- [ ] Implement streaming prediction capabilities
- [ ] Build sentence completion mechanism
- [ ] Create integration with Buffer Manager

### Buffer Manager
- [ ] Implement response buffering logic
- [ ] Add silence detection capabilities
- [ ] Create interrupt handling mechanisms
- [ ] Develop prediction confidence threshold management

### End-to-End Integration
- [ ] Connect STT → LLM → TTS pipeline
- [ ] Implement real-time latency optimizations
- [ ] Create configuration system for end-to-end parameters
- [ ] Build demo application for SCaLE22x presentation

### Documentation & Presentation
- [ ] Write comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Create integration guides for third-party components
- [ ] Design technical presentation for Kwaai collaboration
- [ ] Prepare demo script highlighting key differentiators

### SCaLE22x Preparation
- [ ] Finalize working demo with real-time capabilities
- [ ] Prepare talking points about privacy-first design
- [ ] Create materials explaining Ashtabula architecture
- [ ] Document integration points with Kwaai's pAI-OS

## Next Steps

The immediate focus should be on finalizing the FastWhisper STT implementation, running the tests, and ensuring it works correctly. Once validated, development should proceed with the WebSocket server implementation and Buffer Manager components before tackling the LLM integration.

The goal is to have a functional end-to-end prototype ready for demonstration at SCaLE22x, with clear articulation of how Ashtabula can integrate with and enhance Kwaai's pAI-OS platform.
